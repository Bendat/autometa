# App & World

:::caution
This library uses [TSyringe](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe) to support
dependency injection. You will need a reflect pollyfill like [reflect-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reflect-metadata)
to use the `App` functionality. `reflect-metadata` must be imported early
in your project and ideally only once. A good place to import it is
the very first line of `autometa.config.ts`

```ts title='autometa.config.ts'
import 'reflect-metadata'
....
```

:::

The `App` fixture is undefined by default. It must be created by
you in your project, and configured with `defineConfig`. The `App`
must be class. It must be decorated with `Fixture` and `Persistent`
decorators.

Once configured, the app will be instantiated with a new context
for every scenario run. It contains user defined data and will
be passed to every step callback when executed. It will always be
the last argument passed to the callback. If there are no variables,
docstrings or data tables it will be the only parameter.

```ts title='src/my-app.ts'
import { Fixture, Persistent } from "@autometa/cucumber-runner";

@Fixture
@Persistent
export class MyApp {}
```

The app must be defined in config:

```ts title='autometa.config.ts'
import { defineConfig } from "@autometa/cucumber-runner";
import { MyApp } from
defineConfig({
    app: MyApp
    ...
})
```

Now the app will be available in all step definition callbacks:

```ts title='globals/given.steps.ts'
import { Given } from "@autometa/cucumber-runner";
import { MyApp } from "../src";

Given("a step", (app: MyApp) => {
  expect(app).toBeInstanceOf(MyApp); // pass
});
```

## World

The `App` has been defined but it's seemingly useless. It would be nice
to store data between our steps if there is state that must be shared. We
could do that on the `App` itself, but Cucumber already has a concept
for storing arbitrary data: the implicit [World](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/support_files/world.md).

In Cucumber, step definition callbacks are bound to the World. To access it, then,
one must use the `this` keyword, which necessitates the use of `function`
syntax functions, as `(fat) => arrow` functions cannot access the world.

In Autometa, the World is explicit. To create your own world, define a class
with an index signature so that properties can be arbtirarily defined
and read.

```ts
export class World {
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```

This makes all properties of World unknown, forcing proper type
handling in tests.

However it would be nice to see what properties we _expect_ tests
to want to touch. We can do that using the declare keyword:

```ts
import { Fixture, Persistent } from "@autometa/cucumber-runner";
@Fixture
@Persistent
export class World {
  [key: string]: unknown;

  declare myRequest: Request<MyDto>;
  declare userCount: number;
}
```

This lets tests know that these properties exist and what they look
like. At this point the properties do not exist, but they can be written
to in `Given` and `When` steps and accessed from `Then` steps (for example).

:::tip
`@Persistent` lets Autometa know that the same copy of this object
should always be passed to all dependents per scenario, rather than
create a new instance for each consumer.

As `World` is intended to store test-persistent data, it should be
`Persistent`.
:::

## Attaching World to App

Finally, we want to let our App know about World so it becomes
available in tests.

Simply define it as a public (or readonly( constructor parameter on App.

```ts title='src/my-app.ts'
import { Fixture, Persistent } from "@autometa/cucumber-runner";

@Fixture
@Persistent
export class MyApp {
  constructor(readonly world: World) {}
}
```

And that's it. MyApp and World are now availble in tests.

```ts
Given("a setup step", ({ world }: App) => {
  world.myRequest = {
    /* request json */
  };
});

When("an action step", async ({ world }: App) => {
  world.userCount = await fetch({
    body: world.myRequest,
  });
});

Then("a validation step", ({ world }: App) => {
  expect(world.userCount).toEqual(world.userCount);
});
```
