## Quickstart

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='pagecomponents' label='Page Components'>

```ts title='Define a Root Page Component'
export class Homepage extends PageComponent {
  @ByTestId("login-button")
  loginButton: PageComponent;
  @ByLocator("login-form")
  loginForm: LoginForm;
  @ByPlaceholder('Search For Widgets Now!')
  searchBar: PageComponent
}
```

```ts title='Define Child Components'
export class LoginForm extends PageComponent {}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

# Page Components

Page Components are an alternative interpretation of the popular 'Page Object Model' pattern for UI Automation. They aim to provide
a declarative model of defining the 'shape' of a Website or app in a
composable and reusable fashion.

There are two flavors of the Page Component Model for Playwright:

- Page Components
- Semantic Components

Page Components match the Playwright `Locator` interface. Semantic Components also resemble the `Locator` interface, however by default,
with some exceptions, all Playwright actions, like `click`, `press`, `evaluate`, `type` or `fill` are hidden and treated as `protected` methods
of the `SemanticComponent` class and must be explicitely exposed publically by subclasses, discussed later. Both flavors can be mixed to achieve desired results.

:::caution
This package depends on expiremental decorators and experimental metadata.
Typescript 5 decorators are not currently supported.

As Playwright does not support experimental decorators, tests must be
built before execution. See [Building Playwright Tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-typescript#manually-compile-tests-with-typescript)

```ts title='Example Page Object'

```

## Page Object Model

In the Page Object Model, the _Page Object_ stores locator references
to HTML Elements (or other Web Elements) to any descendant relevant dom element.

For the TodoMvc app, we might define our Page Object Model as so
_Target_: [TodoMVC](https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc)

```ts title='Example Page Object Model'
export class TodoPage {
  todoTitles: Locator;
  newTodoBar: Locator;
  markComplete: Locator;
  todoCount: Locator;
  items: Locator;
  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.todoTitles = page.getByTestId("todo-title");
    this.newTodoBar = page.getByPlaceholder("What needs to be done");
    this.markComplete = page.getByLabel("What needs to be done?");
    this.todoCount = page.getByTestId("todo-count");
    this.items = page.getByTestId("todo-item");
  }
}
```
