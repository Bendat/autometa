# Getting Started

This section will walk you through installing Autometa v1, wiring the coordinator packages, and running your first specification. The steps are intentionally high level for now; expect detailed walkthroughs as the refactor stabilizes.

## Prerequisites

- `Node.js` 18+
- `pnpm` 8+
- A test runner target (`Vitest`, `Playwright`, or `Jest`)

## Next steps

1. Read through the installation notes below.
2. Bootstrap an example project using the commands in the repository root.
3. Explore the package READMEs inside `/packages` for deeper context until the dedicated guides land.
