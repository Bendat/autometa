# Configuration reference

This page captures the configuration surface area that is being stabilized for Autometa v1. Each section links to the relevant package once the documentation is authored.

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autometa.config.ts` | Drafting | New schema to describe runners, feature sources, and providers. |
| `@autometa/runner` | Drafting | Inline hooks and lifecycle events are being renamed for clarity. |
| Decorators | Drafting | Fluent bindings and scopes are moving to the decorators package for tree-shakable usage. |

> **Heads-up:** the values above will change rapidly during the refactor. Track progress in `docs/VERSION_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` until this page is fleshed out.
