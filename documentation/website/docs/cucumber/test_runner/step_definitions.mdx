# Step Definitions

Autometa steps resemble Cucumber JS steps and should be identifiable to
most Gherkin IDE plugins.

The largest difference is that Autometa step callbacks are not bound
to the `World` object. Instead, `World` is a property of the `App` object,
which will passed as the last argument to the step callback.

Because the step is not bound, it is safe to use fat arrow (`=>`) functions.

## Defining a step

Steps can be defined using the `Given`, `When`, or `Then` functions. If the gherkin
file includes `And`, `But` or `*` steps, they can be matched against any of those main 3.
It is advised to define them against the step they follow.

I.e for the steps

```gherkin
Given a foo
And a bar
```

The step `And a bar` should be defined as a `Given`, however this is not enforced.

```ts
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("a foo", () => {
  // ...
});

Given("a bar", () => {
  // ...
});
```

If no matching steps are found, a report will be generated from a fuzzy search,
helping to identify typos.

## App

The `App` object is passed as the last argument to the step callback. If there are no tables
or Cucumber Expressions, it will be the only argument. Apps type must be defined by you (see [Getting Started](./getting_started)),
or else it will be an empty object containing an empty world at the type level.

```ts
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("a foo", (app) => {
  app.webdriver.clickFoo();
});
```

## Async

Step callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous. If you do not want to store
the result and define the function as `async` you can simply return the promise
of the underlying action:

```ts
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("a foo", (app) => {
  return app.http.createFoo({ foo: "test-bar" });
});
```

However if, for example, you want to store the result on the World, you can
await the promise and then store the result:

```ts
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("a foo", async (app) => {
  const foo = await app.http.createFoo({ foo: "test-bar" });
  app.world.foo = foo;
});
```

## Tables

Autometa tables are inspired by the [Java](https://www.baeldung.com/cucumber-data-tables) implementation
which allows tables to be parsed differently according to step.

See [Data Tables](./datatables) for more information on tables.

To use a table in a step, simply append the table type as the last argument to the step definition,
which can be accessed as the first or second to last argument before App in the definition callback.

```gherkin
Given a foo
| foo | bar    | baz   |
| 1   | true   | bobby |
```

This represents a 'Horizontal Table' or `HTable`, where the first row represents the headers
and the rest the data. This can be accessed as follows:

```ts
import { Given, HTable } from "@autometa/runner";

Given(
  "a foo",
  (table: HTable, app) => {
    const fooNum = table.get("foo", 0) as number;
    const fooBool = table.get("bar", 0) as boolean;
    const fooStr = table.get("baz", 0) as string;
    const fooNumString = table.get("foo", 0, true) as string;
  },
  HTable
);
```

:::tip
Datatable values will be converted to their javascript type where possible

i.e strings that represent numbers will be converted to a number, 'true' and 'false'
will be treated as bools while the rest will be parsed as strings.

The original raw value can be accessed by passing `true` as the third argument to `table.get`

```ts
const fooNumString = table.get("foo", 0, true) as string;
```
