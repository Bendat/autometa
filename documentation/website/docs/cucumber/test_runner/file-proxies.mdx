# File Object Proxies

A File Object is a proxy instance tied to some Interface. It is created
by passing filepath to the `FileObject` function. The returned object
will be the type of the generic interface parameter provided to the function.

This object will behave similarly to a plain javascript object, but instead
of being in memory, it instead reads from and writes directly to a file.

This file will be a json file containing the stringified version of the
object you are manipulating.

```ts
import { john } from "./credentials";
interface AuthFile {
  token: string;
  refreshToken: string;
}

const authFile = FileObject<AuthFile>("./auth.json");
const { token, refreshToken } = await authClient.login(john);
authFile.token = token;
authFile.refreshToken = refreshToken;

// somewhere else
const token = authFile.token;
await myClient.get("foo/stuff", token);
```
