# Steps

## Local Steps

Steps definitions are created when one of the `Given` `When` or `Then` functions
are executed. They can be placed at the top level of a file, or nested inside either
`Feature`, `Rule`, `Scenario Outline` `Scenario` functions.

```ts title='Defining Steps'
import { Given, When, Then, Feature, Scenario } = '@autometa/cucumber-runner';

// Top Level Steps
Given('some given step text', ()=>{});
When('some when step text', ()=>{});
Then('some then step text', ()=>{});

// Feature level steps
// these will overrride top level steps is clashing
Feature(() => {
  // Override the top level step for
  // all scenarios in this feature.
  // Also overrides global steps.
  Given("some given step text", () => {})

  Scenario('My Scenario', ()=>{
    // Override the feature step of the same text
    Given('some given step text', () => {})
    // define a new step unique to this scenario
    Given('a new step', ()=>{})

  })
}, './my-file.feature')
```

If a step is defined at two or more levels of nesting (scope) and both
match a `.feature` step, the innermost scope will be used and higher level
matches will be ignored.

## Global Steps

The easiest way to create steps is to use global steps. Global Steps
behave like steps in official Cucumber, where they are registered and
will automatically be assembled into scenarios.

To use global steps, the `globalsRoot` must be defined in `autometa.config.ts`.

```ts
import "reflect-metadata";
import { defineConfig } from "@autometa/cucumber-runner";

defineConfig({
globals: "globals"

});
```

And ensure the config fill is executed by your test runner

```js title='vitest.config.js'
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

defineConfig({
  ...
  setupFiles: ['autometa.config.ts']
  include: ['**/*.{test,spec,feature}.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,mts,cts,jsx,tsx}']
  ...
})

```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="jest" label="Jest">

```js title='jest.config.js'
export default {
  ...
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['autometa.config.ts']
  testMatch: ['**/?(*.)+(spec|test|feature).[jt]s?(x)']
  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>

## Defining Global Steps

Once a global step root has been configured, any steps within the `globalsRoot`
directory will be registered in a global cache. Test files, which are files
executing the `Feature` function from `@autometa/cucumber-runner`, will automatically
assemble their scenarios, rules and scenario outlines using these steps

```ts title='globals/user.steps'
import { Given } from "@autometa/cucumber-runner";

Given("a user logs in", () => {});
```

Then, assuming all relevant steps are defined globally, we can execute our
feature by simply referencing the file.

```ts
import { Feature } from "@autometa/cucumber-runner";

Feature("./my-feature.feature");
```

## Importing Global Steps manually

It may be desireable to declare global steps that
are not automatically imported, for example they cover a seperate
or integrating domain, and may clash with the standard step setup
defined.

To accomodate this, you can define global steps in a file not
inside the `globalsRoot`, and `import` it. This will register
the defined steps for the file being executed.

```ts title='domain-b/user.steps'
Given("a user performs obscure action", () => {});
```

```ts title='test/my-feature.test'
import '../domain-b/user.steps'
import {
  Given,
  When,
  Then,
  Feature,
  Scenario
} from "@autometa/cucumber-runner";

Feature('./my-feature.feature')
```
