# Static Data - Mapping Names to IDs

The endpoint we are looking at currently is `products/{id}`, which retrieves a product
resource by it's numeric ID in the database. This makes sense for the API, but we'd
like our Gherkin to reflect the product itself.

Since we know that in our test environments this resource is static, we can treat it
as static test data. We can create a mapping object that maps the product name to
it's ID in the database. Let's make a const dictionary to map product names to IDs

```ts
// src/controllers/products/product.static.ts

export const ProductIdMap = {
  "iPhone 9": 1
} as const;
```

:::tip
`as const` marks the object as compile time constant. So it's schema is literal, and not
cast to a generic type like `number`.

Without const, when hovering over the map in your editor, its shape would be displayed as

```ts
{
    'iPhone 9': number
}
```

Rather than the literal we want:

```ts
{
    'iPhone 9': 1
}
```

:::

If using multiple environments, like dev, test, etc. we
might want to set those values with `envalid`, however we will lose the constant type literals.

```ts
// src/controllers/products/product.static.ts
import { Env } from "../../app/env";
export const ProductIdMap = {
  "iPhone 9": Env.PRODUCT_ID_IPHONE_9
};

// src/app/env.ts
import { cleanEnv, num, str } from "envalid";

export const Env = cleanEnv(process.env, {
  API_URL: str({ default: "http://localhost:3000" }),
  PRODUCT_ID_IPHONE_9: num({ default: 1 })
});
```

## Using the Static Data With Expressions

We can also take advantage of expressions here to automatically our products
from gherkin.

Consider the following step:

```gherkin
Given I have a product named "iPhone 9"
```

We can create a new `product:static:name` expression to map the product name to
it's corresponding ID and automatically extract it from steps. As before we can
use the `AssertKey` to validate the input.

```ts
// src/controllers/products/product.params.ts
import { ProductIdMap } from "./product.static";
import { defineParameterType } from "@autometa/runner";

defineParameterType(
  {
    name: "product:static:name",
    regex: /"(.*)"/,
    transformer: (name: string) => {
      AssertKey(ProductIdMap, name, `Product Map name ${name}`);
      return ProductIdMap[name];
    }
  } /* .... */
);
```

And update our types:

```ts
import type { App as A, World as W } from "./src";
import type {
  ProductBuilder,
  Product,
  ProductId
} from "./src/controllers/product";
declare module "@autometa/runner" {
  export interface App extends A {}
  export interface World extends W {}
  export interface Types {
    "builder:product": ProductBuilder;
    "product:property": keyof Product;
    "product:static:name": ProductId;
    "world:property:response": keyof W;
  }
}

```

Now we can use this expression in our step definition:

```ts
// src/controllers/products/product.steps.ts
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";
import { ProductIdMap } from "./product.static";

Given(
  "I want to view the product {product:static:map}",
  async (id, { world }) => {
    world.viewProductId = id;
  }
);
```

With all that out of the way we can start to write our gherkin tests
