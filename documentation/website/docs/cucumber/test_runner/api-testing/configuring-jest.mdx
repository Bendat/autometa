# Configuring Jest

Once your `jest.config` has been set up to your liking, we'll need to make some changes
to support the Cucumber Runner.

## Add the Cucumber transformer

With `@autometa/jest-transformer` installed, we can add it as a transform module for `*.feature` files.
We can also make `*.feature` a test extension which Jest can load

```js
// jest.config.ts
default export {
  transform: {
    "^.+\\.feature$": "@autometa/jest-transformer"
  },
  moduleFileExtensions: ["feature", "js", "json", "ts", "tsx"],
  testRegex: "(/integration/feature/.*|(\\.|/)(test|spec))\\.feature$"
};
```

For this example we will hold our tests in `integration/feature` and name them with the `.feature` extension.

## Setup Files After Env

We need to setup the Cucumber environment before Jest runs. We can do this by adding a `setupFilesAfterEnv` property to our Jest config,
and reference our `autometa.config.ts` file and `reflect-metadata`.

```js
// jest.config.ts
export default {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["reflect-metadata", "./autometa/config.ts"]
};
```
