# Schemas and Types

Next we'll define Schemas and our Types/Interfaces for the API Request
and response bodies.

Focusing on `product`, we have the following example:

```ts
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "iPhone 9",
  "description": "An apple mobile which is nothing like apple",
  "price": 549,
  "discountPercentage": 12.96,
  "rating": 4.69,
  "stock": 94,
  "brand": "Apple",
  "category": "smartphones",
  "thumbnail": "...",
  "images": ["...", "...", "..."]
}
```

We can break this down into a shape:

```ts
{
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  discountPercentage: number;
  rating: number;
  stock: number;
  brand: string;
  category: string;
  thumbnail: string;
  images: string[];
}
```

This represents the shape we expect our product objects to have. It's worth
noting that we've lost information. `stock` is defined as a number, but we
specifically want to ensure it's an integer.

We'll create a new file file to define an integer:

```ts
// src/schemas/integer.ts

import { number } from "myzod";

const integerSchema = mz
  .number()
  .withPredicate(
    Number.isInteger,
    (value) => `number must be an integer but got: ${value}`
  );
```

We'll structure our project by controller. We'll create a `product` folder
and name our files with the `product.*.ts` extension. To begin create
`src/controllers/product/product.schema.ts`:

```ts
import { mz } from "myzod";
import { integerSchema } from "../../schemas/integer";

export const ProductSchema = mz
  .object({
    id: mz.number(),
    title: mz.string(),
    description: mz.string(),
    price: mz.number(),
    discountPercentage: mz.number(),
    rating: mz.number(),
    stock: integerSchema,
    brand: mz.string(),
    category: mz.string(),
    thumbnail: mz.string(),
    images: mz.array(mz.string())
  })
```

MyZod has an `Infer<>` type helper which can convert a schema into a type.
Create a new file `src/controllers/product/product.types.ts`:

```ts
import { Infer } from "myzod";
import { ProductSchema } from "./product.schema";

export type Product = Infer<typeof ProductSchema>;
```

Let's also add definitions for `Products` which is an object containing
an array of products, as well as pagination data.

Since MyZod is composable, we can reuse our `productSchema` to define
the list elements.

The example body is:

```ts
import { mz } from "myzod";
import { integerSchema } from "../../schemas/integer";

const ProductsSchema = mz.object({
  products: mz.array(productSchema),
  total: integerSchema,
  skip: integerSchema,
  limit: integerSchema
});
```

And update our types

```ts
import { Infer } from "myzod";

export type Product = Infer<typeof productSchema>;

export type Products = Infer<typeof productsSchema>;
```

Since we'll often be dealing with responses, we can define their types here too.

```ts
import { Infer } from "myzod";
import { HTTPResponse } from "@autometer/runner";

export type Product = Infer<typeof productSchema>;
export type ProductResponse = HTTPResponse<Product>;

export type Products = Infer<typeof productsSchema>;
export type ProductsResponse = HTTPResponse<Products>;

```

Next we'll look at creating a client to make requests to our API.
