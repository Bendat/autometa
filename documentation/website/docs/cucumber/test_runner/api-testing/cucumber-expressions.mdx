# Enhancing Steps With Cucumber Expressions

In the last section we looked at setting up a builder for our request DTOs. Now we'll look at
using cucumber expressions to take instantiation logic away from our step definitions.

## Cucumber Expressions

Cucumber expressions are a way of defining a pattern that can be used to match a step definition
to a step. They are similar to regular expressions, but are more readable and easier to use.

For example, the following step:

```gherkin
Feature: Cucumber Expressions

  Scenario: Using Cucumber Expressions
    Given I have a product named 'Foo Phone'
```

We can extract the name using the `string` expression:

```ts
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("I have a product named {string}", (name, { world }) => {
  world.productBuilder = new ProductBuilder().name(name);
});
```

However we can create a new Cucumber Expression which will create the builder for
us, and we can just assign it to the world.

```ts
// src/product/product.params.ts
import { defineExpression } from "@autometa/runner";

 defineExpression({
  name: "builder:product"
  regexpPattern: [/'([^']*)'/, /"([^"]*)"/],
  transform: (name: string) => new ProductBuilder().name(name)
 });
```

This will match any substring that is surrounded by single or double quotes, and
returns a `ProductBuilder` instance with the name set.

To ensure this expression is loaded, we'll add a glob to our config matching
`.params.ts` files.

```ts
// autometa.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@autometa/runner";

export default defineConfig({
  runner: "jest",
  roots: {
    features: ["integration/features"],
    steps: ["integration/steps"],
    app: ["src/app.ts"],
    // vvvvvvvvvv
    params: ["src/**/*.params.ts"]
  },
  shim: {
    errorCauses: true
  }
});
```

We also need to update our `Types` interface to recognize the builder
expression.

```ts
import { App as MyApp, World as MyWorld } from "../src/app";
import { ProductBuilder } from "../src/product/product.builder";

declare module "@autometa/runner" {
  interface App extends MyApp {}
  interface World extends MyWorld {}
  interface Types {
    "builder:product": ProductBuilder;
  }
}
```

We can now easily generate new product builders from steps using expressions.

```ts
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("I have a product named {builder:product}", (builder, { world }) => {
  world.productBuilder = builder;
});
```

We can also create an expression to extract the property keys from the Product type:

```ts
// src/product/product.params.ts
import { defineExpression } from "@autometa/runner";

 defineExpression({
  name: "builder:product"
  regexpPattern: [/'([^']*)'/, /"([^"]*)"/, /[^\s]+/],
  transform: (name: string) => new ProductBuilder().name(name)
 }, {
  name: "product:property",
  transform: (value) => value as keyof Product
 });
```

This allows us to match either a whole word without quotation marks, or a quoted string
which represents the property name as multiple words.

So where `name` is the property, both of these will match:

```gherkin
* `I have a product with name 'Foo Phone'`
* `I have a product with 'name' 'Foo Phone'`
```

Some properties are multiple words with camelCase, like `discountPercentage`.
It would be nice if we could avoid the "code speak" and use a more natural language
like `discount percentage`. We can accomplish that with `phrases`, which we'll discuss in the
next section.

Before then, lets add a validation to our expression so it can fast-fail the test when given an invalid
input from gherkin. You may not want to do this step if you want to be able to test for input with unknown
properties.

Since interfaces/types don't exist at run time, and a DTO is empty until it is built, we cannot
compare our expression value to those. The builder, however, has a method of the same name as
the DTO property that is guaranteed to be defined if the DTO was properly decorated with `@Property`.

Autometa includes a helper assertion, `AssertKey` to guarantee the property exists:

```ts
// src/product/product.params.ts
import { defineExpression, AssertKey } from "@autometa/runner";
import { ProductBuilder } from './'

 defineExpression({
  name: "builder:product"
  regexpPattern: [/'([^']*)'/, /"([^"]*)"/, /[^\s]+/],
  transform: (name: string) => new ProductBuilder().name(name)
 }, {
  name: "product:property",
  transform: (value) => {
    AssertKey(ProductBuilder, value, `Product property key ${value}`)
    return value as keyof Product
  }
 });
```

Finally we can update our types:

```ts
import type { App as MyApp, World as MyWorld } from "../src/app";
import type { ProductBuilder, Product } from "../src/product";

declare module "@autometa/runner" {
  interface App extends MyApp {}
  interface World extends MyWorld {}
  interface Types {
    "builder:product": ProductBuilder;
    "product:property": keyof Product;
  }
}
```

We can now use a "Builder Pattern" in our Gherkin steps to reduce the number
of Step definitions we have defined.

```gherkin
Feature: Adding a Product

    Scenario: I add a new product
        Given I have a product named 'Foo Phone'
        * I set the product description to 'A phone that is foo'
        * I set the product price to 100
```

```ts
import { ProductBuilder } from "../../src/products/product.builder";
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("I have a product named {string}", (name, { world }) => {
  world.productBuilder = new ProductBuilder().withName(name);
});

Given(
  "I set the product {builder:property} to {primitive}",
  (property, value, { world }) => {
    world.productBuilder = world.productBuilder.assign(property, value);
    // or
    world.productBuilder = world.productBuilder[property](value);
  }
);
```

Next we'll look at using phrases to make our steps more readable and hide implementation detail.
