# Data Tables

Datatables are tables attached to a gherkin step

```gherkin
Given a step with a table
    | name | age |
    | John | 24  |
```

If one is defined, it will always be the second to last argument passed
to a step definition callback function. If there are no cucumber expression
arguments, it will be the first argument.

This library includes extended handling of data tables inspired by
the [Java Implementation](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/main/cucumber-java#data-tables)

Tables can be defined with multiple different structual formats.
By default, tables will be converted to `HTable`, for....

## Horizontal Table

class: `HTable`

The horizontal table assumes that the first row of the table structure
is a list of headings or titles that describe the purpose of the column
below it.

```gherkin
Given a step with a table
    | name | age |
    | John | 24  |
    | Bill | 25  |
```

The HTable accesses data using this header.

```ts
Given("a table", (table: HTable) => {
  expect(table.get("name")).toEqual(["John", "Bill"]);
  expect(table.get("name", 0)).toEqual("John");
  expect(table.get("age")).toEqual([24, 25]);
  expect(table.get("age", 0)).toEqual(24);
});
```

## Vertical Table

class: `VTable`

The vertical table assumes that the first column of the table structure
is a list of headings or titles that describe the purpose of the row
to the right of it.

```gherkin
Given a step with a table
    | name | John | Bill |
    | age  | 24   | 25   |
```

The VTable accesses data using this header.

```ts
Given("a table", (table: VTable) => {
  expect(table.get("name")).toEqual(["John", "Bill"]);
  expect(table.get("name", 0)).toEqual("John");
  expect(table.get("age")).toEqual([24, 25]);
  expect(table.get("age", 0)).toEqual(24);
});
```

:::tip
By default all tables will be converted to `HTable`. This can
be overwritten in `autometa.config.ts`, or configured on a step by
step bases. Taking the above step as an example, to tell Autometa that
we want to use a VTable specifically for this step, we pass the VTable
class prototype as the third step definition argument:

```ts
Given(
  "a table",
  (table: VTable) => {
    expect(table.get("name")).toEqual(["John", "Bill"]);
    expect(table.get("name", 0)).toEqual("John");
    expect(table.get("age")).toEqual([24, 25]);
    expect(table.get("age", 0)).toEqual(24);
  },
  VTable
);
```

This step will now be constructed with a VTable.

## Matrix Table

class: `MTable`

The matrix table is similar to a HTable _and_ a VTable at the same time.
It assumes the first row is a list of titles for the columns below it,
while the first colum is a list of titles for the row cells to the right
of it. A cell is then an intersection of these two values.

The first cell (0,0) is discarded and ignored. You may use it
to hold metatext about the table such as it's axis

```gherkin
Given a step with a table
    | size/color | large | small   |
    | blue       | ocean | gumball |
    | green      | hill  | grass   |
```

The HTable accesses data using this header.

```ts
Given("a table", (table: MTable) => {
  expect(table.get("blue", "large")).toEqual("ocean");
  expect(table.get("green", "small")).toEqual("grass");
});
```

## List Table

class: `ListTable`

A list table assumes there are no special rows or columns which act
as headers. Effectively a wrapper over a `string[][]`.

# Type Casting

Autometa will attempt to parse table values into javascript primitives
if they are applicable. Currently supported are `boolean` and `number`.

That is to say, if a table cell contains the string `2`, it will be cast
to an number. Likewise `true` will be a bool. This does not apply if they are
surrounded by quotation marks, i.e `"2"` will not parse to a number.
