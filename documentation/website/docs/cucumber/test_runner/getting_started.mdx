# Getting started

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

This guide assumes you are at least familiar with authoring tests in [Cucumber.js](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/javascript/)
and gherkin format.

Autometa is primarily a runner for gherkin tests which leverages the functionality
and performance of Jest.

Implementing step definitions should feel familiar, however Autometa offers a difference
perspective of the `World` object, and uses dependency injection with [tsyringe](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe)
to reduce the need for boilerplate and and allow you to worry less about bootstrapping your environment.

## Install

To begin, add Autometa to your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev autometa
```

If your test framework is it's own standalone project or repo, you may want to save it as a dependency
rather than a dev-dependency, so you can make use of convencience libraries from your `src/` folder or equivalent.
This will depend on your typescript setup.

### Style

There are two ways of authoring tests (more below):

- Gherkin
- jest-cucumber

If using the jest-cucumber style that's all you need. If wish to execute `.feature` files directly, you will
need to install the [jest-transformer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@autometa/jest-transformer)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @autometa/jest-transformer
```

You will need to add this to your jest config under `transform`.

To use some features, you must have a reflection metadata shim, like [`reflect-metadata`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reflect-metadata)

## Config

To start, create a file in your project root called `autometa.config.ts`, and point to it
in the `jest.config` files `setupFilesAfterEnv` - which is also a good location to import `reflect-metadata`.

```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["reflect-metadata", "./autometa.config.ts"]
}
```

:::tip
You can call the config file whatever you want as long as jest loads it
:::

Now you can add configuation to your `autometa.config.ts` file using the `defineConfig` function.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "autometa";

defineConfig({});
```

In order to run our tests we need a path to the directory containing Step Definitions,
and to the directory where the `App` and `World` are contained. These are necessary
to automatically load Autometa at test time. Alternatively you can add these paths
to your `jest.config` file as `setupFilesAfterEnv`.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "autometa";

defineConfig({
  roots: {
    steps: ["test/steps"],
    app: ["src/app"]
  }
});
```

## App & World

The `App` and `World` are the entry points to your application. A new instance of `App` is
passed to each step definition as the last (or only) argument. App is a container for
dependency injected service classes, such as HTTP clients, database clients, etc.

The app instance is unique to each executing test, and is accessible to `Before` and
`After` hooks. This way tests cannot interfere with one anothers state.

World, as in standard Cucumber, is a container for the current state of your application
and is automatically injected into the App. Like the App, each World is unique to A
given test and its corresponding hooks.

Using the structure defined above, our App and World have the following file structure:

```
./
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── app.ts
│   │   └── world.ts
|   |   └── index.ts
├── test/
│   ├── steps/
│   │   └── ...
├── autometa.config.ts
```

To define an App class, decorate it with the `@AppType` decorator and pass it a reference
to the World class.

```ts
import { AppType } from "@autometa/runner";
import { World } from "./World";

@AppType(World)
export class App {
  // ...
}
```

The App will not be available in step callbacks.

```ts
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("my simple step", (app) => {
  app.world.foo = 2;
});
```

You can also safely destructure app properties

```ts
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("my simple step", ({ World }) => {
  app.world.foo = 2;
});
```

### World

The world is a simple container object. You can declare properties on it that
you believe will be relevant to your tests for autocompletion. They do not
have to been defined with the world. They can be left empty until a test fills
their values.

Depending on your Typescript settings, you can use any of the following declaration styles:

<Tabs groupId='gherkin-expression'>
  <TabItem value="Define" label="Define">

```ts
import { MyComplexObject } from "../objects";

export class World {
  [key: string]: unknown;
  foo: number;
  bar: string;
  baz: MyComplexObjectType;
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Assert" label="Assert">

```ts
import { MyComplexObject } from "../objects";

export class World {
  [key: string]: unknown;
  foo!: number;
  bar!: string;
  baz!: MyComplexObjectType;
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Declare" label="Declare">

```ts
import { MyComplexObject } from "../objects";

export class World {
  [key: string]: unknown;
  declare foo: number;
  declare bar: string;
  declare baz: MyComplexObjectType;
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Declaration files

We've defined our App and our World, and they're now available in our tests - however
we cannot see any of the type information we created in either. This is because
App is represented by an Empty interface internally. We can fix this by creating
a declaration file and overriding the `@autometa/app` package using our new classes

This file can be placed anywhere, for now we'll place it next to our app. Our directory
structure now looks like:

```
./
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── app.ts
│   │   ├── autometa.d.ts
│   │   └── world.ts
|   |   └── index.ts
├── test/
│   ├── steps/
│   │   └── ...
├── autometa.config.ts
```

To make these types active, we must add them as a type root in `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "...": "...",
    "types": ["jest", "./autometa.d.ts"]
  }
}
```

To override the interfaces, declare the module and implement your classes as below:

```ts
import type { App as OurApp, World as OurWorld } from "./src";

declare module "@autometa/app" {
  export interface App extends OurApp {}
  export interface World extends OurWorld {}
}
```

## Step Definitions

With our App and World available, we can make use of them in Step Definitions.
Step definitions follow the same structure as `Cucumber.JS` however they have a major
distinction: The `World` object in Autometa is accessed as an argument, not through
the `this` keyword. As a result, fat arrow functions are valid for step definitions.

```ts
// fully type inferred
Given("a step", ({ world }) => {
  world.foo = 2;
});
```

Step Definitions must exist in files under the configred `stepDefinitionsRoot` directory,
and must have one of the following filename patterns:

- `*.steps.ts`
- `*.given.ts`
- `*.when.ts`
- `*.then.ts`

There is no requirement that a `*.given.ts` must contain only givens etc. Steps can be mixed
in a single file to your liking.

### Arguments

Step definitions can accept arguments generated through Cucumber Expressions. When Autometa
detects a cucumber expression in a step definition, it will automatically infer it as
an argument in the callback.

```ts
// src/app/world.ts

export class World {
  [key: string]: unknown;
  dogCount: number;
  dogName: string;
}

// test/steps/dogs.steps.ts
Given("I own {int} dogs", (dogCount, { world }) => {
  world.dogCount = dogCount; // OK
  world.dogName = dogCount; // ERROR - string is not assignable to number
});
```

This avoids the need to manually type your arguments, which can lead to confusing
errors when the wrong type is assumed and passed to a function.

### Custom Expression Types

The standard Cucumber expression types are already mapped, however if you
create your own custom types, which will be inferred by your callback. If none
is provided, it will be typed `unknown`.

Like before, we override the `@autometa/scopes` module with a `Types`
interface. The default interface is as follows:

```ts
export interface Types {
  [key: string]: unknown;
  text: string;
  word: string;
  string: string;
  number: number;
  float: number;
  int: number;
  any: any;
  unknown: unknown;
  boolean: boolean;
  date: Date;
  primitive: string | number | boolean | Date;
}
```

Now append a custom type (existing types will be persisted)

```ts title='autometa.d.ts'
declare module "@autometa/scopes" {
  export interface Types {
    myCustomType: MyCustomType;
  }
}
```

Now this type will be automatically inferred when your step contains the expression `{myCustomType}`. To learn
how to create custom types, see the [Custom Types](./cucumber_expressions) guide.

### Tables

Autometa adds more sophisticated table support than Cucumber.js, taking
inspiration from Javas variadic table types.

Autometa supports the following table types by default:

- Horizontal - first row treated as headers
- Vertical - first column treated as headers
- Matrix - first row and column treated as headers
- List - Wrapper over an array of string arrays (string[][])
  - Can represent a raw table or a table without headers

Additionally, Autometa tables automatically parse the contents of each table cell,
converting them to primitive types where applicable. This means that if you have a
table cell with the number `2` in it, it will be parsed into the Javascript `number` type,
rather than represented by the string '2'. This will also apply to booleans.

It is possible to access the raw string value also.

To use a table, pass it as the last argument in your step definition. The type will
automatically picked up and inferred by the step callback. When a table is present,
it will always be the argument before the app. I.e if there are no expressions,
the table will be the first argument. If there are expression arguments, it will
be the second to last argument

```ts title='No Expressions'
import { Given, HTable } from "@autometa/runner";

Given(
  "I have the following dogs",
  (table, { world }) => {
    const firstRow = table.get("header1");
    const firstCell = table.get("header1", 0) as number;
  },
  HTable
);
```

```ts title='With Expressions'
Given(
  "I have {int} dogs",
  (dogCount, table, { world }) => {
    // ...
  },
  HTable
);
```

### Hooks

The following hooks are supported:

- Before
- After
- setup
- Teardown

Hooks can be defined in files with the following extensions, and should be located under the `stepDefinitionsRoot`

- `*.before.ts`
- `*.after.ts`
- `*.setup.ts`
- `*.teardown.ts`

#### Setup

The setup hook is executed before any tests are run. It is useful for bootstrapping the environment.
The setup call back recieves a special copy of the app which is shared between all `Setup` and `TearDown`
calls but not tests or other hooks.

```ts
import { Setup } from "@autometa/runner";

Setup("Setup the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  app.world.foo = 2;
});
```

#### Before

The before hook is executed before each test. It is useful for setting up the world in advance
of a test, setting up data from the service or preparing data base entries.

Before recieves the same copy of the `App` that the test it preceeds will have.

```ts
import { Before } from "@autometa/runner";
import { setupFooObject } from "../objects";

Before("Setup the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.post("/foo", setupFooObject);
});
```

#### After

The after hook is executed after each test. It is useful for cleaning up data from the service
or database, or resetting the environment to a known state.

After recieves the same copy of the `App` that the test it succeeds will have.

```ts
import { After } from "@autometa/runner";

After("Reset the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.delete("/foo", app.world.someId);
});
```

#### Teardown

The teardown hook is executed after all tests have run. It is useful for cleaning up the environment
after all tests have run. It shares the same copy of the `App` as the `Setup` hook.

```ts
import { Teardown } from "@autometa/runner";

Teardown("Reset the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.delete("/foo?type=testType");
});
```

## Running a test

FInally, we can set up the files neede to run our tests. We have several approaches for this.

### Test file

The simplest approach is to create a test file using the `Feature` function to reference
a gherkin file.

To begin, add `.feature.ts` as a test pattern in your jest.config

```json
{
  "testMatch": ["**/*.steps.ts", "test/impl/**/*.feature.ts"]
}
```

This example will look for `*.feature.ts` files under the `test/impl` directory.

Now create a file `test/impl/my.feature.ts`, importing `Feature` and passing
a path to a feature file.

```ts
import { Feature } from "@autometa/runner";

Feature("../features/my.feature");
```

If you've setup a `featuresRoot` you can use the `^/` prefix to reference a file.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Relative" label="Relative">

```ts
import { Feature } from "@autometa/runner";

Feature("../impl/my.feature");
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="FeatureRoot" label="Feature Root">

```ts
import { Feature } from "@autometa/runner";

Feature("^/my.feature");
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Config" label="Config">

```ts
import { defineFeature } from "@autometa/runner";

defineFeature({
  roots: {
    feature: "./test/impl"
  }
});
```

This will construct scenarios from globally defined steps.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Spec-like

Spec-like is set up the same way as a test file, however it allows nested functions, which
allow steps that are shared between scenarios, but also uniquely implemented per scenario (or rule, or outline)
when desireable. This approach resembles the `jest-cucumber` libraries approach.

Like test file, it requires a `feature.ts` file but accepts a callback before the path.

```ts
import {
  Feature,
  Given,
  Scenario,
  Rule,
  ScenarioOutline
} from "@autometa/runner";
// test/steps/foo.steps.ts
Given("a globally defined step", () => {
  // ...
});

// test/impl/my.feature.ts
Feature(() => {
  Given("a step shared between all scenarios in this feature", () => {
    // ...
  });

  Scenario("my scenario", () => {
    Given("a step unique to this scenario", () => {
      // ...
    });
  });

  ScenarioOutline("my scenario outline", () => {
    Given("a step unique to this scenario outline", () => {
      // ...
    });
  });
  Rule("my rule", () => {
    Given("a step unique to this rule", () => {
      // ...
    });

    Scenario("my scenario", () => {
      Given("a step unique to this scenario", () => {
        // ...
      });
    });
  });
});
```

It is not necessary to define all steps, scenarios, etc. within the `Feature` - missing scenarios
or groups will be automatically constructed provided all the steps exist in any higher scope, including
those globally defined by the step definition root.

### Gherkin

To run Gherkin `.feature` files directly against globally defined steps, then `@autometa/jest-transformer`
package is needed, and must be added to `jest.config` under `transform`.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @autometa/jest-transformer
```

```json
{
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.feature$": "@autometa/jest-transformer"
  }
}
```

And `.feature` must be added to the `testMatch` pattern.

```json
{
  "testMatch": ["**/*.feature"]
}
```

Now gherkin files can be run directly

```sh
npx jest test/features/my.feature
```

## Fixtures

Fixtures are classes which can be dependency injected automatically into each other,
and the App. Where the app maintains the state of the application, fixtures attached to
the app represent behaviors you want to perform, such as HTTP or GraphQL clients, database
connections etc.

Fixtures are defined as classes decorated with the `@Fixture` decorator. They can be
injected into each other, and the App, by adding them as arguments to the constructor.
This functionality depends on `reflect-metadata` and `experimentalDecorators` being enabled
in your `tsconfig.json`.

```ts
// src/clients/http.ts
import { Fixture, Inject } from "@autometa/runner";

@Fixture
export class MyHttpClient {
  async get(path: string) {
    return this.app.httpClient.get(path);
  }
}

// src/app/app.ts
import { AppType } from "@autometa/runner";
import { MyHttpClient } from "../clients/http";
import { World } from "./world";

@AppType(World)
export class App {
  constructor(readonly httpClient: MyHttpClient) {}
}
```

If for some reason automatic injection is not working, it can be specified with the `Inject` decorator.

```ts title='src/app/app.ts'
import { AppType, Inject } from "@autometa/runner";
import { MyHttpClient } from "../clients/http";
import { World } from "./world";

@AppType(World)
export class App {
  @Inject(MyHttpClient)
  readonly httpClient!: MyHttpClient;
}
```
