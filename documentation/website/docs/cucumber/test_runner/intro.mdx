# Autometa

Autometa is a toolkit of libraries to supercharge automation testing
in [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/javascript/), built
to work with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and in future [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

Primarily Autometa is centered around it's cucumber runner, however it also maintains
a number of standalone libraries that might be useful in various projects:

- [**Builder Pattern**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@autometa/dto-builder) - Automatically
  generate Builder pattern classes from a DTO class using decorators
- [**Status Codes**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@autometa/status-codes) - Object containing
  HTTP status codes and standard text
- [**Overloaded**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@autometa/overloaded) - Easily handle variadic arguments
  in overloaded or pattern based functions and methods

## Cucumber Runner

Autometa's Cucumber Runner brings gherkin to Jest. Inspired by [Jest Cucumber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-cucumber) Autometa supports 3 styles of writing tests, which can be mix and match

- Nested function callbacks
  - This option strongly resembles both Jests `describe -> it` pattern and jest-cucumbers nested
    structure
- Global steps
  - This option more closely resembles `cucumberjs`, using globally defined steps that
    are assembled into scenarios at runtime
  - Global steps can be used as shared steps when using nested callbacks, so common steps
    are defined globally while test specific steps are defined only where they're needed
- Gherkin Only
  - Very similar to cucumberjs, executing `.feature` files with globally defined steps,
    bypassing the need to create intermediary testfiles.

### Features

#### Automatic inference for Step Definition arguments

Leverages Typescripts type system to automatically infer Cucumber Expression arguments
from its string literal

```ts
// Given I have 5 cats
Given("I have {int} {word}", (count, animal) => {
  // -- inferred as 'number' ---^     |
  // ----- inferred as 'string' ------â”˜
});
```

#### Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection wires together your complex behaviors simply.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="fixture" label="Fixture">

```ts title="src/http/client.ts"
import { Fixture } from "@autometa/runner";

@Fixture
export class HttpClient {
  async get(...args) {}
  async post(...args) {}
  async put(...args) {}
  async delete(...args) {}
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="app" label="App">

```ts title="src/app/app.ts"
import { AppType } from "@autometa/runner";
import { HttpClient } from "../http/client";
import { World } from "../world/world";

@AppType(World)
export class App {
  // http is automatically injected
  constructor(readonly http: HttpClient) {}
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="step" label="Step Definition">

```ts title="src/steps/given.ts"
import { Given } from "@autometa/runner";

Given("I have a {user}", async (user, { world, http }) => {
  world.getUserResponse = await http.get(`/users/${user}`);
});
```

  </TabItem>

#### Custom Cucumber Expressions

Improved support for custom Cucumber Expressions.

See [Cucumber Expressions](./cucumber_expressions) section.

#### Fuzzy Search for Missing Step Definitions

Easily identify typos in step definitions using fuzzy search error reporting.

#### Flexible

Write your tests like jest-cucumber, or by executing gherkin `.feature` files using
Jest transformations.
