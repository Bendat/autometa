# Phrases

Phrases, or 'Human Readable Phrases' are a pattern of obscuring implementation
details when writing gherkin, by creating phrases that can be transformed into
index keys of some object.

Imagine are performing an API test and we have 2 relevant steps:

- `When I create the user`
  - Makes a HTTP call to our APIs POST /user endpoint with the DTO { name: "John", email: "john@bobmail.com" }
  - Stores the response in the World object under the key `createUserResponse`
- `Then 'createUserResponse' result is 'OK'`
  - Asserts that the response stored in the World object under the key `createUserResponse` has a status code of 200
  - Generic step that can be reused across any API test
  - We want to use a more abstracted key, `'Create User'` instead of implementation detail `'createUserResponse'`

### Using Phrases

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="exposed" label="Exposed Details">

```gherkin title=Gherkin
Scenario: Creating a user
  Given I have a user with the name "John"
  And the users email is "john@bobmail.com"
  When I create the user
  Then 'createUserResponse' result is 'OK'
```

```ts title=Steps
import { Given, When, Then } from "@autometa/runner";
import { StatusCodes } from "@autometa/status-codes";

Given("I have a user with the name {string}", ({ world }, name) => {
  world.createUserDto = { name };
});

Given("the users email is {string}", ({ world }, email) => {
  world.createUserDto.email = email;
});

When("I create the user", async ({ world, http }) => {
  world.createUserResponse = await http.post("/user", world.createUserDto);
});

Then(
  "{string} result is {string}",
  (property, status, { world }, key, value: keyof StatusCodes) => {
    // assert status to equal { status: 200, statusText: "OK" }
    expect(world[key].status).toEqual(StatusCodes[value]);
  }
);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="phrase" label="Human Friendly Phrase">

```gherkin title=Gherkin
Scenario: Creating a user
  Given I have a user with the name "John"
  And the users email is "john@bobmail.com"
  When I create the user
  Then 'Create User' result is 'OK'
```

This removes the code-style camelCased variable, but no longer represents a property of the world.
To accomplish this, we can access the `World.fromPhrase` method, which will process the gherkin
string with some rules we can define, such as making it `camelCase` or `snake_case`, or adding a
prefix or suffix

```ts title=Steps
import { Given, When, Then, sfx, camelCase } from "@autometa/runner";
import { StatusCodes } from "@autometa/status-codes";

Given("I have a user with the name {string}", ({ world }, name) => {
  world.createUserDto = { name };
});

Given("the users email is {string}", ({ world }, email) => {
  world.createUserDto.email = email;
});

When("I create the user", async ({ world, http }) => {
  world.createUserResponse = await http.post("/user", world.createUserDto);
});

Then(
  "{string} result is {string}",
  (property, status, { world }, key, value: keyof StatusCodes) => {
    // 'Create User' -> 'Create User Response' -> 'createUserResponse'
    const key = world.fromPhrase(property, sfx`Response`, camel);
    expect(world[key].status).toEqual(StatusCodes[value]);
  }
);
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

```ts title=World
import { AutometaWorld } from "@autometa/runner";
import { HTTPResponse } from "http-library";

export class World extends AutometaWorld {
  declare createUserDto: CreateUserDto;
  declare createUserResponse: HTTPResponse;
}
```

### Transformers

Phrases are controlled by transformer or `mutation` actions which are appended
to the phrase. They are applied in the order they are defined. Some, like the case-mutations (camel, upper) will
override previous.

- `camel` - converts the phrase to camelCase
- `snake` - converts the phrase to snake_case
- `kebab` - converts the phrase to kebab-case
- `pascal` - converts the phrase to PascalCase
- `sfx` - adds a suffix to the phrase with a space
- `pfx` - adds a prefix to the phrase with a space
- `trim` - trims the phrase, removing all white leading and trailing space
- `lower` - converts the phrase to lower case
- `upper` - converts the phrase to upper case

It's also possible to use phrases generically, in your steps or in other parts of your
supporting code

```ts
import { camel, sfx, From } from "@autometa/runner";

const dummyObject = {
  statusCode: 200
  statusText: 'OK'
};

const status = From(dummyObject).byPhrase("status", sfx`text`, camel) as string;
```

You can also attach a phrase parser to classes with a decorator:

```ts
import { camel, sfx, From, IFromPhrase PhraseParser } from "@autometa/runner";

@PhraseParser
class DummyObject {
  statusCode: number;
  statusText: string;
  declare fromPhrase: IFromPhrase
}

```

A phrase parser will be injected into instances of the class and can be used directly:

```ts
const dummyObject = new DummyObject();

const status = dummyObject.fromPhrase("status", sfx`text`, camel) as string;
```

---

Only one `case` mutation can be succesfully applied to a phrase, however some custom
output formats should be achievable.

For example the format `dbCollection__Users` could be achieved with

```ts
From(foo).byPhrase("Db Connection", camel, sfx`__Users`, trim);
```

Which camel cases the phrase, adds a suffix of `__Users` and trims white space between them.
