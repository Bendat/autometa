# Setting Up

In this tutorial we'll walk through setting up an Autometa based API testing framework in a Typescript project.
The goal of this guide is to end up with a project that can run tests against a local server, or a live
deployed service.

From Autometa we'll use the following libraries:

- `@autometa/runner` - Our Cucumber executor
- `@autometa/builder`

We'll also use some third party libraries:

- [MyZod](https://github.com/davidmdm/myzod), [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or other schema
  validation library you like.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) or other HTTP client you like.
- [Envalid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/envalid) which is a schema validator for the
  environment variables in our project. You could also make your own with MyZod or Zod

## Pre Setup

To begin, set up a new Typescript project to your preferred configuration. If starting
from scratch, you can use a project template such [this](https://github.com/themetalfleece/nodejs-typescript-template).
