# Date Time

Autometa provides some utilities for working with dates and times during automation tests.

The `Dates` object contains handy helpers to create common dynamic dates like 'tomorrow',
'next week', 'yesterday' etc.

```ts
const dto = {
    dateCreated: Dates.yesterday(),
}
```

The Dates object also supports phrases such as '5 days from now'

```gherkin title=Gherkin
Given a promotion starting '5 days from now'
```

Date phrases can be extracted from steps using the `{date}` expression parameter type.
```ts
Given('a promotion starting {date} from now', (date: Date) => {
    // --------- dates type is automatically inferred ^
    // explicit type can be avoided.
})
```

However iso date strings and short date strings are also accepted:

```gherkin title=Gherkin
Given a promotion starting '2021-01-01'
Given a promotion starting '2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'
```

The Date expression must be wrapped in quotation marks.
