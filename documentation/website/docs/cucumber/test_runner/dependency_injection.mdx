# Dependency Injection

## Introduction

Autometa supports the dependency injection pattern, which it uses to
automatically assemble complex relationships between, in particular,
classes.

A class can be marked as injectable using the `Fixture` decorator:

```ts
@Fixture()
class Foo {}
```

By default, fixtures are marked as `Cached`, meaning that a single instance
is shared between all dependants. This can be changed by passing and
Injection Scope, of which there are `Cached`, as discussed, `Transient`, and
`Singleton`.

A transient dependency is never cached. Each dependant property
will be instantiated with a new instance of the transient dependency.

A cached depenenency is cached for the lifetime of the test container. A new Test container
is created for each Scenario being tested. Once instantiated, that cached instance will
be used in all other dependant properties. However, a new instance is created for each
new Scenario and cannot be shared between them

A singleton dependency behaves similar to a cached dependency, except that
the instance created is reused across all test containers. This means for each `Feature`
file, only one copy of this dependency will exist across all test scenarios.

```ts
@Fixture(InjectionScope.Singleton)
class SingletonFoo {}

@Fixture(InjectionScope.Transient)
class TransientFoo {}
```

## Dependencies

Dependencies are injected into a class using one of the `Inject` decorators.
There are presently 3 such decorators:

- `Inject.class` - Injects an instance of a class into the property. If the class is marked singleton or cached, the existing instance will be reused.
- `Inject.factory` - Accepts a factory function whose return value will be injected into the property.
- `Inject.value` - Injects a literal value, such as a string, number, array or anonymous object.

```ts
@Fixture()
class Foo {
  @Inject.class(Bar)
  bar: Bar;

  @Inject.factory(() => new Baz())
  baz: Baz;

  @Inject.value("Hello World")
  message: string;
}
```

## Constructor Injection

Autometa also supports constructor injection. This allows you to describe
a constructor to behave as you wish.

To match the constructor to it's dependencies, the `Constructor` decorator
may be used. This decorator accepts a list of fixture classes or tokens. The order
of this list must match the order of the constructor arguments.

```ts
@Fixture()
@Constructor(Bar, Baz, Token("message"))
class Foo {
  constructor(bar: Bar, baz: Baz, message: string) {}
}
```

## Interacting with a Container

The container is available in Hooks and Step Definitions through the app,
where it is attached as the `di` property. It can be used to register
new dependencies without relying on the `@Fixture` syntax. Note that
fixtures have already been constructed at this point, so dependencies
defined here will not be available through static injection via decorators
if that class is instantiated before the new dependency is registered.

```ts
Before("I register a value", async (app) => {
  const asyncData = await app.myClient.getAsyncData();
  app.di.registerValue("asyncData", asyncData);
});

After("I use the registered value", (app) => {
  const asyncData = app.di.get("asyncData");
});
```

## Tokens

Tokens can be used to represent a dependency without a class reference. This can be performed by attaching a token
based dependency to the `App.di` property. This can be done in a `Before` or `Setup` hook, or in a step definition callback.

```ts
import { Token } from "@autometa/injection";

Before("I register a token", async (app) => {
  app.di.register
});


To define a value with a token you can use `registerSingleton` function from `@autometa/injection`.

:::info
Tokens must be registered before the test container is created. Test containers are created at 2 points:
- When a `Setup` hook is run. Depdendencies defined here will be available to all scenarios in the feature file.
- When a `Scenario` is run. Dependencies defined here will not be available during class instantiation time, as that has already occured
  - However these dependencies are available within scenarios via the `App.di` property
