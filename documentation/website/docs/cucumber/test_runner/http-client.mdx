# HTTP Client

One of the included fixtures provided is the `HTTP` client. Unlike most
fixtures which are which behave like singletons within the context of
a Scenario, the HTTP client is "transient", and each time it is injected
a new copy is created.

It is accessed as a normal fixture, by defining it as a constructor
parameter for whatever fixture or App is consuming it.

```ts
@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {}
}
```

The client is unusual in that it behaves as a 2-part builder patten. Certain information,
such as the API URL, routes or common headers can be stored statefully within the client itself

```ts
@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.http
      .url("https://api.example.com")
      .sharedRoute("v2")
      .sharedHeader("x-example", "true");
  }
}
```

However when a non shared header or route is set, it creates a new request context,
which will contain values set in the client, and allow collect any new headers,
routes, query parameters, or payload data that are set. This context uses the same
naming scheme for methods as the `Http` class itself.

```ts
@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.http
      .url("https://api.example.com")
      .sharedRoute("v2")
      .sharedHeader("x-example", "true");
  }

  getProduct(id: number) {
    return this.http.route("products").route(id).get();
  }

  getProducts(limit?: number) {
    return (
      this.http
        .route("products")
        // resolves to /v2/products?limit=10
        .param("limit", limit)
        .get()
    );
  }
}
```

## Hooks

The http client has two hooks:

- `onBeforeSend` which is triggered when the request has been constructed but no request has been made.
- `onRecievedResponse` which executes after the response has been received, if axios did not throw an error.

`onBeforeSend` receieves a copy of the current request state, and can be useful for logging.

```ts
export type RequestState = {
  headers: Map<string, string>;
  params: Map<string, unknown>;
  url: string;
  route: string[];
  responseType: ResponseType | undefined;
  data: unknown;
  method: Method;
  get fullUrl(): string;
};
```

`fullUrl` is the full resolved url of the request including parameters and routes, i.e.
`https://api.example.com/v2/products/1?limit=10`

`onRecievedResponse` receives the response object, and the request state. It can be used to
run assertions against a response or again for logging.

```ts
export class HTTPResponse<T> {
  status: number;
  statusText: string;
  data: T;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  request: {
    url: string;
    method: Method;
  };
}
```

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
const ResponseSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  name: z.string()
});

@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.http
      .url("https://api.example.com")
      .sharedRoute("v2")
      .sharedOnBeforeHook(this.logRequest)
      .sharedOnRecievedResponseHook(this.logResponse);
  }

  logRequest({ method, url }: RequestState) {
    console.log(`making ${method} request to ${url}`);
  }

  logResponse(response: HTTPResponse<unknown>) {
    console.log(`recieved ${response.status} response from ${method} ${url}`);
  }
}
```

## Schema Validation

The client accepts a `schema` map, which is a mapping of a schema parsing object to a HTTP status code
or list of status codes. A schema is registered as an object with a `parse` method, which accepts the
response data and returns a parsed object, or throws an error.

Example using `zod`:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
const ResponseSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  name: z.string()
});

@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.http
      .url("https://api.example.com")
      .sharedRoute("v2")
      .sharedHeader("x-example", "true");
  }

  getProduct(id: number) {
    return (
      this.http
        .route("products")
        // single value
        .schema(ResponseSchema, 200)
        // list
        .schema(ResponseSchema, 200, 201, 204)
        // range
        .schema(ResponseSchema, { from: 200, to: 204 })
        .route(id)
        .get()
    );
  }
}
```

## Derived Responses

Responses can be 'derived' from other responses. With this, the status, and header
information remains the same but a new response object is produced, using a value
taken from the original response as it's data.

Imagine you have steps to validate a product stored in the world:

```ts
import { Then, AssertKey } from "@autometa/runner";
// Then the product name is 'bob'
// Then the product price is 10
Then("the product {string} is {primitive}", (key, value, { world }) => {
  AssertKey(world.myProduct, key);
  const product = world.myProduct;
  expect(product[key]).toEqual(value);
});
```

And later you're implementing the `products` endpoint which gets all products
as an object with a paginated list:

```ts
{
    products: Product[];
    pagination: {
        total: number;
        limit: number;
        offset: number;
    }
}
```

It would be nice to easily reuse our existing steps to validate the product, by making
a new step to add it as `myProduct`, which is a `HTTPResponse<Produxt>`

```ts
Then("I examine product {int}", (index, { world }) => {
  const response = world.productsResponse;
  //   const data = response.data.products[index];
  world.myProduct = HTTPResponse.derive(
    response,
    ({ products }) => products[index]
  ); // now HTTPResponse<Product>
});
```

Which lets you reuse your existing step.

```gherkin
Scenario: some scenario
    ...
    ...
    Then I examine product 1
    * the product name is 'bob'
    * the product price is 10
    And I examine product 2
    * the product name is 'alice'
    * the product price is 20
```
