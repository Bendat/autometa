# HTTP Client

One of the included fixtures provided is the `HTTP` client. Unlike most
fixtures which are which behave like singletons within the context of
a Scenario, the HTTP client is "transient", and each time it is injected
a new copy is created.

It is accessed as a normal fixture, by defining it as a constructor
parameter for whatever fixture or App is consuming it.

```ts
@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {}
}
```

The client is unusual in that it behaves as a 2-part builder patten. Certain information,
such as the API URL, routes or common headers can be stored statefully within the client itself

```ts
@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.http
      .url("https://api.example.com")
      .sharedRoute("v2")
      .sharedHeader("x-example", "true");
  }
}
```

However when a non shared header or route is set, it creates a new client with a new
request context, which will inherit values set in the original client, but
modifcations happen in this new contex and do not mutate the shared client.

```ts
@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.http
      .url("https://api.example.com")
      .sharedRoute("v2")
      .sharedHeader("x-example", "true");
  }

  getProduct(id: number) {
    return this.http.route("products").route(id).get();
  }

  getProducts(limit?: number) {
    return (
      this.http
        .route("products") // creates a new client with the route set to /v2/products
        // resolves to /v2/products?limit=10
        .param("limit", limit) // creates a new client with the param set to 10
        .get() // makes the request and returns the response using all data set thus far
    );
  }
}
```

## Hooks

The http client has two hooks:

- `onSend` which is triggered when the request has been constructed but no request has been made.
- `onRecieve` which executes after the response has been received, if axios did not throw an error.

`onBeforeSend` receieves a copy of the current request immediately before it is sent. It can be used
to log the request, or run assertions against it.

```ts
export type HTTPRequest<T> = {
  url: string;
  method: Method;
  params?: Record<string, string>;
  fullUrl: string;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  data?: T;
};
```

`fullUrl` is the full resolved url of the request including parameters and routes, i.e.
`https://api.example.com/v2/products/1?limit=10`

`onRecievedResponse` receives the response object, and the request state. It can be used to
run assertions against a response or again for logging.

```ts
export class HTTPResponse<T> {
  status: number;
  statusText: string;
  data: T;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  request: {
    url: string;
    method: Method;
  };
}
```

## Schemas

Schemas are function or validator objects which are mapped to a response status code.
A Schema validates the data payload of the response, and throws an error if the response does
not match the required shape or other validation.

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
const ResponseSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  name: z.string()
});

@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.http
      .url("https://api.example.com")
      .sharedRoute("v2")
      .sharedOnBeforeHook(this.logRequest)
      .sharedOnRecievedResponseHook(this.logResponse);
  }

  logRequest({ method, url }: RequestState) {
    console.log(`making ${method} request to ${url}`);
  }

  logResponse(response: HTTPResponse<unknown>) {
    console.log(`recieved ${response.status} response from ${method} ${url}`);
  }
}
```

### Schema Validation

The client accepts a `schema` map, which is a mapping of a schema parsing object to a HTTP status code
or list of status codes. A schema is registered as an object with a `parse` method, which accepts the
response data and returns a parsed object, or throws an error.

Example using `zod`:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
const ResponseSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  name: z.string()
});

@Fixture
export class MyClient {
  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.http
      .url("https://api.example.com")
      .sharedRoute("v2")
      .sharedHeader("x-example", "true");
  }

  getProduct(id: number) {
    return (
      this.http
        .route("products")
        // single value
        .schema(ResponseSchema, 200)
        // list
        .schema(ResponseSchema, 200, 201, 204)
        // range
        .schema(ResponseSchema, { from: 200, to: 204 })
        .route(id)
        .get()
    );
  }
}
```

### Default Schemas

A number of default schemas are provided for cases where the response
is not JSON, or the response is empty.

- AnySchema
  - Accepts any response and returns it as is
- EmptySchema
  - Accepts `null`, `undefined` or the string 'null' and returns `null` or `undefined`.
- NullSchema
  - Accepts `null` or the string 'null' and returns `null`.
- UndefinedSchema
  - Accepts `undefined` and returns `undefined`.
- BooleanSchema
  - Accepts `true`, `false` or the strings 'true' or 'false' and returns a boolean of the same value.
- NumberSchema
  - Accepts any number or string which can be parsed as a number and returns a number.
- StringSchema
  - Accepts any string and returns it as is.
- JSONSchema
  - Accepts any JSON string and returns the parsed JSON object, or accepts a JSON objet and returns it
    as is.
## Decomposed Responses

Responses can be 'decomposed' from other responses. With this, the status, and header
information remains the same but a new response object is produced, using a value
taken from the original response as it's data.

Imagine you have steps to validate a product stored in the world:

```ts
import { Then, AssertKey } from "@autometa/runner";
// Then the product name is 'bob'
// Then the product price is 10
Then("the product {string} is {primitive}", (key, value, { world }) => {
  AssertKey(world.myProduct, key);
  const product = world.myProduct;
  expect(product[key]).toEqual(value);
});
```

And later you're implementing the `products` endpoint which gets all products
as an object with a paginated list:

```ts
{
    products: Product[];
    pagination: {
        total: number;
        limit: number;
        offset: number;
    }
}
```

It would be nice to easily reuse our existing steps to validate the product, by making
a new step to add it as `myProduct`, which is a `HTTPResponse<Produxt>`

```ts
Then("I examine product {int}", (index, { world }) => {
  const response = world.productsResponse;
  //   const data = response.data.products[index];
  world.myProduct = HTTPResponse.decompose<Product>(
    response,
    (products) => products[index]
  ); // now HTTPResponse<Product>
});
```

Which lets you reuse your existing step.

```gherkin
Scenario: some scenario
    ...
    ...
    Then I examine product 1
    * the product name is 'bob'
    * the product price is 10
    And I examine product 2
    * the product name is 'alice'
    * the product price is 20
```
