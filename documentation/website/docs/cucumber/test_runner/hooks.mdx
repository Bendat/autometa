# Hooks

The following hooks are supported:

- Before
- After
- setup
- Teardown

Hooks can be defined in files with the following extensions, and should be located under the `stepDefinitionsRoot`

- `*.hooks.ts`
- `*.before.ts`
- `*.after.ts`
- `*.setup.ts`
- `*.teardown.ts`

## Setup

The setup hook is executed before any tests are run. It is useful for bootstrapping the environment.
The setup call back recieves a special copy of the app which is shared between all `Setup` and `TearDown`
calls but not tests or other hooks.

```ts
import { Setup } from "@autometa/runner";

Setup("Setup the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  app.world.foo = 2;
});
```

## Before

The before hook is executed before each test. It is useful for setting up the world in advance
of a test, setting up data from the service or preparing data base entries.

Before recieves the same copy of the `App` that the test it preceeds will have.

```ts
import { Before } from "@autometa/runner";
import { setupFooObject } from "../objects";

Before("Setup the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.post("/foo", setupFooObject);
});
```

## After

The after hook is executed after each test. It is useful for cleaning up data from the service
or database, or resetting the environment to a known state.

After recieves the same copy of the `App` that the test it succeeds will have.

```ts
import { After } from "@autometa/runner";

After("Reset the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.delete("/foo", app.world.someId);
});
```

## Teardown

The teardown hook is executed after all tests have run. It is useful for cleaning up the environment
after all tests have run. It shares the same copy of the `App` as the `Setup` hook.

```ts
import { Teardown } from "@autometa/runner";

Teardown("Reset the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.delete("/foo?type=testType");
});
```


## Order Of Execution

Hooks are executed according to 2 orders:

### The order in which the hooks files are loaded.

Hooks will be loaded in filesystem order. Consider the following directory,
which will be in `test/steps`:
  
```plaintext
  test/steps
  ├── common.hooks.ts
  ├── cleanup.hooks.ts
  ├── products/
  │   ├── products.hooks.ts
```

Hooks will be executed in the following file order:

1. `common.hooks.ts`
2. `cleanup.hooks.ts`
3. `products/products.hooks.ts`

### The order in which the hooks are defined in the file.

Hooks will be executed in the order they are defined in the file. Consider the following file:

```ts
// common.hooks.ts
import { Before, After } from "@autometa/runner";

Before("Setup the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.post("/foo", setupFooObject);
});

Before("Setup the services 'bar'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.post("/bar", setupBarObject);
});

```

The `Setup the services 'foo'` hook will be executed before the `Setup the services 'bar'` hook.
So the first before hook that will be executed is `Setup the services 'foo'` and the second will be `Setup the services 'bar`,
followed by the `Before` hooks in the next file and so on.
