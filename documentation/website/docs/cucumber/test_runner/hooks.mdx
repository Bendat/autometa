# Hooks

The following hooks are supported:

- Before
- After
- setup
- Teardown

Hooks can be defined in files with the following extensions, and should be located under the `stepDefinitionsRoot`

- `*.hooks.ts`
- `*.before.ts`
- `*.after.ts`
- `*.setup.ts`
- `*.teardown.ts`

## Setup

The setup hook is executed before any tests are run. It is useful for bootstrapping the environment.
The setup call back recieves a special copy of the app which is shared between all `Setup` and `TearDown`
calls but not tests or other hooks.

```ts
import { Setup } from "@autometa/runner";

Setup("Setup the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  app.world.foo = 2;
});
```

## Before

The before hook is executed before each test. It is useful for setting up the world in advance
of a test, setting up data from the service or preparing data base entries.

Before recieves the same copy of the `App` that the test it preceeds will have.

```ts
import { Before } from "@autometa/runner";
import { setupFooObject } from "../objects";

Before("Setup the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.post("/foo", setupFooObject);
});
```

## After

The after hook is executed after each test. It is useful for cleaning up data from the service
or database, or resetting the environment to a known state.

After recieves the same copy of the `App` that the test it succeeds will have.

```ts
import { After } from "@autometa/runner";

After("Reset the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.delete("/foo", app.world.someId);
});
```

## Teardown

The teardown hook is executed after all tests have run. It is useful for cleaning up the environment
after all tests have run. It shares the same copy of the `App` as the `Setup` hook.

```ts
import { Teardown } from "@autometa/runner";

Teardown("Reset the services 'foo'", (app) => {
  return app.myHttpClient.delete("/foo?type=testType");
});
```
