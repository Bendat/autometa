# Referencing Feature files

The `Feature` function takes a filepath to the gherkin `feature` file it tests. There are mulitiple strategies to identify a feature file.

## Project Relative

If no prefix is attached to a file path, it will be found
relative to the project root:

```ts
/**
 * This option will resolve to `/path/to/project-root/features/my-feature.feature
 */
Feature("features/my-feature.feature");
```

## Absolute

If your feature files have an absolute path it will be used as is.

```ts
Feature("/user/ci/features/my-feature.feature");
```

## Relative

If your path starts with `./` or `../` it will be treated as a relative path. It wil be relative to the _file_
executing it.

```ts
/**
 * assuming this is in `<root>/e2e/
 *
 * The first option will resolve to `/path/to/project-root/e2e/my-feature.featre
 * And the second option will resolve to `/path/to/project-root/features/my-feature.featre
 */
Feature("./my-feature.feature");
Feature("../features/my-feature.feature");
```

## Features root

You can define a `featuresRoot` in `defineConfig`. That value must be a directory path string. If it is set,
featues in that file can be accessed from anywhere in the project by using a filepath relative to that root.
To actually indicate the path starts at the feature root, prepend it with `^/`. When
this pattern is detetected, the path will be resolved as if it were relative, but it is relative to `<root>/<featuresRoot>`.

Assuming the feature root is `features`:

```ts
/**
 * This option will resolve to `/path/to/project-root/features/my-feature.featre
 */
Feature("^/my-feature.feature");
```

## Home directory

A path starting with a tilde and slash (`~/`) will be treated as an
relative path starting at the users home directory.

## Directories & Globs

It's possible for a `Feature` function to exeute more than one `.feature` file. This can
be done by passing a directory, which will be walked for all feature files and will then be executed.

Alternatively this can be done by passing a file glob. This will behave the same as a directory but
will only execute `.feature` files which match a pattern

```ts
// by dir
Feature("../features");
//by glob
Feature("../features/user-*.feature");
// or broader glob
Feature("**/*.feature");
```

:::caution
If executing multiple feature files or entire directories, please note
you may lose the benefits of frameworks like jest or vitest where they can parallelize
different files.
