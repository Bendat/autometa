# Autometa v1 Docs

Welcome to the brand-new Autometa v1 documentation set. The v1 refactor introduces a unified automation toolkit with consistent APIs across runners and adapters. These docs are a fresh start: everything here is authored specifically for v1 and will grow as the rewrite lands.

## What to expect

- **Clear getting started paths** for each supported runner.
- **Deep dives** on the new scope-aware architecture, lifecycle hooks, and decorator APIs.
- **End-to-end guides** that show how the packages inside `/packages` fit together for real projects.

If you are looking for the previous documentation, use the version dropdown in the navigation bar and pick *Legacy (v0)*.
