# Autometa v1 Docs

Autometa v1 is now live. The refactor that unified our runners, DTO builders, and assertion tooling has shipped, and this site documents the release you can install from the public registry today.

## What you can expect

- **Task-focused guides** that mirror the source in `/examples`, so every instruction maps to a working project.
- **Architecture notes** describing how the coordinator, executors, scopes, builders, and plugins cooperate at runtime.
- **Reference docs** you can trust during delivery—callouts highlight when a feature still varies by runner or package version.

## Where to start

1. Head to [Getting Started → Installation](getting-started/installation.md) for the runner-specific setup tabs.
2. Clone or browse the projects in `/examples` to compare each supported runner implementation side by side.
3. Explore the architecture and reference sections for deeper dives into decorators, the `DtoBuilder`, and the `ensure(...)` plugin system.
