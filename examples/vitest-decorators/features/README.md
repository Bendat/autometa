# Brew Buddy Feature Catalogue

The scenarios in this directory define the living documentation for Autometa examples. They describe the Brew Buddy coffee bar domain and provide comprehensive coverage for Autometa capabilities.

## Domains

- `catalog/` — Managing menu items, seasonal drinks, and pricing adjustments.
- `orders/` — Placing, customising, and fulfilling customer beverage orders.
- `data/` — Working with data tables, doc strings, and calculated outputs.
- `tags/` — Demonstrating tag expressions, skipping, and focused execution.
- `http/` — Exercising the Autometa HTTP client for API interactions.

Each example package should mirror these features and implement matching step definitions.
